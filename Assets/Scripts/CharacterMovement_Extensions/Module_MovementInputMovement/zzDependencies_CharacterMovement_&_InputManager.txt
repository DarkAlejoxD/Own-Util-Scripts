-	The folder/namespace depends on:
	-	Character Movement Folder
		-	This is an Extension for the CharacterMovement Folder, so it depends Directly from there
	-	InputManagerBase
		-	This extension adds the funcionality of the Inputs related to the Movement to the InputManager Class,
			so Depends also from InputManagerBase.

-	Aditionally:
	-	Input Manager class depends on the New Input System package.
		(Last checked v1.7.0 in Unity 2022.3.16f1) if any compilation error or smtg, rewrite
		InputManager class.

If imported the whole folder, download the Input System, otherwise, you can create your own
Input system. PlayerMovement.cs is meant to be flexible in both cases, that's why it don't
implement any way of read input.


 -	TODO:
	-	Jump behaviour
		-	Consider rewrite a new one instead of import of the Mario project
		-	Different behaviour for First Person/Third Person?
	-	Import PointnClick from Atka
	-	¿Import FPS Head movement by Marti Garriga?
